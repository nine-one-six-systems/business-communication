            <h2>Opening Communication</h2>
            <p>Stephen,</p>
            <p>I'm getting this to you because I want to get a version of this out to Kent, Shawn, and Greg. Then a more condensed version out to Nic, Joseph, and other select potential partners.</p>
            <p>I haven't been the best over the last two years at communicating, it's something God has been really working on me with because of the responsibility He's gifted us with. I'm committing to changing that, and I'd like to ask for your help if you're willing to give it.</p>
            <p>We worked extremely hard to create core values that ACTUALLY represent who we want to be, one of those values being transparency. I see the lack of communication from me (on my part) as a lack of transparency with the people who are integral to this entire journey. It may seem like a big ask (or maybe it seems silly), but I would be forever grateful if you would be willing to hold me accountable to communicating with our team, clients, and partners regularly.</p>
            <p><em>Kent, Greg, Shawn -</em></p>
            <p><em>It may seem like a big ask (or maybe it seems silly) but I would be forever grateful if you would be willing to let me know when/if you feel like you're in the dark on what's being worked on and/or how your experience, fits into the massive vision we are trying to accomplish.</em></p>
            <p><em>I know you have been walking down this road with Stephen much longer than I have, you've bled with him and have had his back for years. I can't express how thankful and appreciative I am of you welcoming me into your circle the way you have and I know none of what Stephen and I have been working on would be possible without all of the work, effort, time, money etc. you put in. I know I'm the new kid at the table, I want to always respect what you've done and the vision that you've had for what all of this becomes. So, if anything I say or do violates that, please, please let me know.</em></p>
            <p>All of that being said, this is my attempt at transparent communication. I want to provide clarity on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our values</li>
                <li>What we're building</li>
                <li>Where we are now</li>
                <li>Where we're going together</li>

        <section class="values-section">
            <h2>Our Values: The Foundation</h2>
            <p>From the start of walking down the road of building something, we wanted to make sure whatever we were a part of stood on values and ACTUALLY lived and worked those values. No one is perfect, and I know I'll mess up at times, but I always want to filter the decisions being made through this set of values and ensure they set the tone for everything we do.</p>

                <div class="value-title">Relationships – People Over Profit, Always</div>
                <p>Business isn't a transaction, it's personal. We build genuine partnerships that last, valuing long-term connection over short-term gains. We treat people right because it matters to us - not because it's "good business." Trust, respect, and fairness aren't optional. They're how we operate.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Stewardship – Build with Integrity, Execute with Honor</div>
                <p>We share information openly and follow through on commitments. When we make mistakes, we own them and extract the lessons. We protect both our team and our partners because their success is our success. Trust grows from consistent actions, not promises.</p>

            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Improvement – Consistent Growth Over Time</div>
                <p>Nothing in nature stays still, it either grows or dies. We need continuous evolution to feel alive and purposeful. When we stop learning, we stagnate. When we embrace change and push ourselves daily, we thrive. We choose growth because it energizes us, challenges us, and ensures we're building something that lasts.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Wisdom – Honor Experience, Welcome Change</div>
                <p>We balance experienced perspectives with fresh thinking, data with discernment, and action with reflection. This blend of stability and innovation creates space for meaningful insights. We stay humble enough to learn, thoughtful enough to question, and confident enough to act.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Courage – Take the Hard Road, Do What Others Won't</div>
                <p>We take on the hard problems others shy away from. Meaningful challenges energize us, they fulfill our need to contribute and grow. When the path gets difficult, our values keep us moving forward. Conviction drives us, not fear.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Revelry – Life Should Be Fun</div>
                <p>Work should energize us, not drain us. When we have fun, we're more creative, more connected, and more effective. Positivity fuels momentum. If success doesn't feel good, we're doing it wrong. We choose joy because it brings out our best work.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Collaboration – The Smartest People in the Room Aren't Always in the Room</div>
                <p>We don't believe in lone wolves. We move fast because we leverage collective intelligence, not individual ego. Diverse perspectives make us better. Different insights, backgrounds, and expertise create stronger solutions. The best execution happens together.</p>

            <p>To quote you: "We want NineOneSix to be like the power company, or Verizon—no one thinks about the power company, they just know they all have to use it." (I'm paraphrasing.)</p>
            <p>The way we think about NineOneSix has morphed and changed significantly over the last two years, so I want to align and make sure we are on the same page with the most up-to-date and clear picture.</p>
            
            <div class="vision-mission">
                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>We envision a world where business infrastructure is as invisible and reliable as electricity - where every founder can build their dreams without sacrificing the relationships and moments that matter most. NineOneSix Systems will transform business ownership from a prison of endless tasks into a vehicle for passion, creativity, and human connection.</p>
                
                <h3>Mission:</h3>
                <p>At NineOneSix Systems, our mission is to build a decentralized core utility layer, intentionally diluted across dozens of aligned owners to prevent concentrated power, safeguard against corruption, and foster resilience and innovation through broad, equitable equity distribution. From this foundation, we will spin off multiple sub-companies, some directly affiliated, others independent, each aligned with our vision, featuring concentrated ownership for dedicated operators and stakeholders, with non-universal overlap to promote expertise, accountability, and majority stakes, as we collectively reshape the future of business.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>What Makes Up the Utility Layer</h3>
            <p>At NineOneSix Systems, the foundational elements of our decentralized utility layer are embodied in our core sub-companies, each designed to provide seamless, reliable business infrastructure that empowers founders to focus on innovation and human connection.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Forge:</strong> Delivers cutting-edge software development and technology infrastructure, building the digital backbone that scales effortlessly like electricity.</p>

        <!-- Lucepta Section -->
        <section class="venture-section">
            <h2>Lucepta: How We Got Here and the Opportunity</h2>
            <p>Arnie asked me why we were committed to healthcare technology and I had to think about it and have been thinking about it for two days now. My first answer was "because we put people first and do the hard things," which is true, but that's not the only reason. Part of it is the massive opportunity, but there are tons of opportunities out there.</p>
            <p>I think the real reason is because we committed to people that we would move forward, and we keep our word. Also, it's what brought everyone together.</p>
            <p>The need for healthcare technology is how we started actually working together. It's why you started up a new entity, it's why I asked to integrate into your business, it's how NineOneSix was formed. But also how we found Joseph, how we figured out our tax positioning, how we started going down the crowdfunding and SEC registration route, and how we brought in more opportunities into Trade Stone Group.</p>
            <p>Even more so, it accomplishes exactly what we envisioned with NineOneSix - creating a world "where every business owner can build their dreams without sacrificing the relationships and moments that matter most." The more we got into the industry, the more we found the independent pharmacy world to be our exact client avatar - they're people who got into business to help people and are now being crushed by bad tech, unorganized partners, and an industry that needs reform.</p>
            <p>All of that being said, I feel like it's safe to say we're committed to walking down the Healthcare Tech road.</p>
            
            <p>We've been working for the past year on several fronts that combine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reverse Distribution</li>
                <li>Pharmacy Supply</li>
                <li>Pharmacy Rx Renewals</li>
                <li>Pharmacy Short Fills</li>
                <li>Medical Supply</li>
                <li>Clinical Services</li>
                <li>Comprehensive Medication Management</li>
                <li>SaaS EMR Platform w/ Lab Integration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Our plan:</strong> Consolidate all of these services into one solution - Lucepta.</p>
            
            <div class="current-status">
                <h4>Current status:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>90% of the Lucepta portal completed</li>
                    <li>95% of mobile development completed and ready for production (via Relevant Solutions)</li>
                    <li>Relationship with PHS defined for lab network integration</li>
                    <li>Ready to acquire FCR for reverse distribution IP</li>
                    <li>Working to integrate Astor Drugs network into SupplyRx</li>
                    <li>Planning to leverage Astor's pharmacy relationships through white-label offering</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Combined, we believe this to be a business model capable of reaching $100-500MM in valuation within the next 5 years.</p>

            <h2>Meridian 44: The Paradigm Shift We're Building</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem We're Attacking</h3>
            <p>We see two massive value extractions destroying professional expertise:</p>
            
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>The AI Training Heist:</strong> OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google built $100B+ scraping expert content without compensation. The result? Mediocre AI creating medical errors, legal sanctions, and what Apple Research calls an "illusion of thinking." We're watching decades of professional knowledge get stolen, commoditized, and degraded.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The PE Strip-Mining Operation:</strong> 4,000+ physician practices acquired, 40% of dental consolidated, accounting and law firms disappearing daily. These professionals thought they were getting liquidity—instead they became employees watching their life's work generate someone else's returns.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>What We're Creating: The Expert-Owned Alternative</h3>
            <p>Meridian 44 is our answer—a complete inversion of the extraction model.</p>
            <p>We're building infrastructure where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expert contributions become equity stakes through SAFE agreements</li>
                <li>Knowledge generates ongoing royalties instead of one-time sales</li>
                <li>Professionals keep their businesses while building proprietary tech assets</li>
                <li>Custom solutions enhance expertise rather than replacing it with generic software</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our architecture: 44 specialized verticals, 4,000-6,000 verified experts, each documenting and contributing expertise to train AI that they actually own.</p>
            
            <h3>The Financial Engineering We've Developed</h3>
            <p><strong>For our expert partners, we enable:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>35-45% taxable income reduction through strategic expense allocation</li>
                <li>Ordinary income → capital gains conversion (17-27% rate differential)</li>
                <li>$10M+ platform value creation from $500K-$1M investment</li>
                <li>$1.5M+ licensing revenue generation over 10 years</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>For us, we're building:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defensible moats through verified expert training data</li>
                <li>Network effects through peer review and quality assurance</li>
                <li>Recurring revenue through platform royalties and licensing</li>
                <li>Exit optionality through distributed ownership that prevents hostile takeover</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why This Aligns With Everything We're Doing</h3>
            <p>Meridian 44 embodies our core thesis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decentralized ownership prevents the concentrated power we're fighting against</li>
                <li>Utility layer thinking makes expert knowledge as accessible as electricity</li>
                <li>Stewardship values ensure experts benefit from their contributions forever</li>
                <li>Collaborative model proves the smartest people really aren't always in our room</li>

            <p>Trade Stone Group is probably the least defined piece of this whole picture because there are so many different opportunities (along with risks) that can be generated from TSG. While there have been a ton of ideas over the last few years (and some I'm sure you've had that I don't even know about), the heart behind Trade Stone Group has been stewardship, the opportunity to give back and bless people, the opportunity to create wealth, and to create stability among increasing economic uncertainty.</p>
            <p>We've frameworked a number of models for investment types, additional private funds, public funds, and even a fintech firm. Whether or not any of that happens, or if it happens under TSG or a whole different set of entities, is still up in the air. But on my side I want to honor the work everyone put into creating unique and excellent strategies while being a good steward of the massive financial blessing God's given us the opportunity to be a part of.</p>
