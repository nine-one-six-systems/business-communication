            <h2>Nic,</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>I haven't been the best over the last two years at communicating, it's something that God has been really working on me with because of the responsibility He's gifted us with. I'm committing to changing that and I'd like to ask you for your help if you're willing to give it. We worked extremely hard to create core values that ACTUALLY represent who we want to be, one of those values being transparency - I see the lack of communication from me as a lack of transparency with the people who are integral to the entire journey. It may seem like a big ask (or maybe it seems silly) but I would be forever grateful if you would be willing to let me know when/if you feel like you're in the dark on what's being worked on and/or how your experience, fits into the massive vision we are trying to accomplish.</p>
            <p>I know you have been walking down this road with Stephen much longer than I have, you've bled with him and have had his back for years. I can't express how thankful and appreciative I am of you welcoming me into your circle the way you have and I know none of what Stephen and I have been working on would be possible without all of the work, effort, time, money etc. you put in. I know I'm the new kid at the table, I want to always respect what you've done and the vision that you've had for what all of this becomes. So, if anything I say or do violates that, please, please let me know.</p>
            <p>All of that being said, this is my attempt at transparent communication. I want to provide clarity on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How we see you fitting into all of this</li>
                <li>The values we feel represent everything we've been working on</li>
                <li>What we're building</li>
                <li>Where we are now</li>
                <li>Where we're going together</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- How You Fit In Section -->
        <section class="opening-letter">
            <h2>How We See You Fitting Into All of This</h2>
            <p> We haven't been the clearest on our focus and how we see you fitting into everything. I want to be very clear - Stephen, myself, Kent, Greg, and Shawn all want you to be part of NineOneSix - not just as a bookkeeper but as part of the leadership. I know your heart is to leave something for your children, and we want you to be a part of everything we're currently building with the ability for you to leave a legacy to them.
                I would LOVE to be able to offer you a full-time position today with benefits and everything else, but unfortunately I'm not able to at this exact moment. That being said, this may change in the next 1-3 weeks - we're currently evaluating what we have the capacity to do.
                Like Stephen said, don't stop pursuing the YMCA if that's what you need to do for you and your family - but we want you to know we have every intention of bringing you on in a full-time financial director role as soon as it's possible, and we want you to help us grow everything we're doing.
                I know you have a lot going on right now, so there's no current expectation on you from our side. This is just my attempt at being transparent and making our intention crystal clear.
                Thank you so much for your friendship, and know we're constantly praying for you.</p>

            <h2>Our Values: The Foundation</h2>
            <p>From the start of walking down the road of building something, we wanted to make sure whatever we were a part of stood on values and ACTUALLY lived and worked those values. No one is perfect, and I know I'll personally mess up at times, but I always want to filter the decisions being made through this set of values and ensure they set the tone for everything we do.</p>

            <p>To quote Stephen: "We want NineOneSix to be like the power company, or Verizon—no one thinks about the power company, they just know they all have to use it." (I'm paraphrasing.)</p>
            <p>The way we think about NineOneSix has morphed and changed significantly over the last two years, so I want to align and make sure we are on the same page with the most up-to-date and clear picture.</p>
            
            <div class="vision-mission">
                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>We envision a world where business infrastructure is as invisible and reliable as electricity - where every founder can build their dreams without sacrificing the relationships and moments that matter most. NineOneSix Systems will transform business ownership from a prison of endless tasks into a vehicle for passion, creativity, and human connection.</p>
                
                <h3>Mission:</h3>
                <p>At NineOneSix Systems, our mission is to build a decentralized core utility layer, intentionally diluted across dozens of aligned owners to prevent concentrated power, safeguard against corruption, and foster resilience and innovation through broad, equitable equity distribution. From this foundation, we will spin off multiple sub-companies, some directly affiliated, others independent, each aligned with our vision, featuring concentrated ownership for dedicated operators and stakeholders, with non-universal overlap to promote expertise, accountability, and majority stakes, as we collectively reshape the future of business.</p>

            <h3>What Makes Up the Utility Layer</h3>
            <p>At NineOneSix Systems, the foundational elements of our decentralized utility layer are embodied in our core sub-companies, each designed to provide seamless, reliable business infrastructure that empowers founders to focus on innovation and human connection.</p>

        <!-- Lucepta Section -->
        <section class="venture-section">
            <h2>Lucepta: How We Got Here and the Opportunity</h2>
            <p>Someone asked me why we were committed to healthcare technology and I had to think about it and have been thinking about it for two days now. My first answer was "because we put people first and do the hard things," which is true, but that's not the only reason. Part of it is the massive opportunity, but there are tons of opportunities out there.</p>
            <p>I think the real reason is because we committed to people that we would move forward, and we keep our word. Also, it's what brought everyone together.</p>
            <p>The need for healthcare technology is how we started actually working together. It's why Stephen started up a new entity (NTSHT originally), it's why I asked to integrate into Stephen's business, it's how NineOneSix was formed. But also how we found Joseph, how we figured out our tax positioning, how we started going down the crowdfunding and SEC registration route, and how we brought in more opportunities into Trade Stone Group.</p>
            <p>Even more so, it accomplishes exactly what we envisioned with NineOneSix - creating a world "where every business owner can build their dreams without sacrificing the relationships and moments that matter most." The more we got into the industry, the more we found the independent pharmacy world to be our exact client avatar - they're people who got into business to help people and are now being crushed by bad tech, unorganized partners, and an industry that needs reform.</p>
            <p>All of that being said, I feel like it's safe to say we're committed to walking down the Healthcare Tech road.</p>
            
            <p>We've been working for the past year on several fronts that combine:</p>
            <ul>

            <h2>Meridian 44: The Paradigm Shift We're Building</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem We're Attacking</h3>
            <p>We see two massive value extractions destroying professional expertise:</p>
            
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>The AI Training Heist:</strong> OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google built $100B+ scraping expert content without compensation. The result? Mediocre AI creating medical errors, legal sanctions, and what Apple Research calls an "illusion of thinking." We're watching decades of professional knowledge get stolen, commoditized, and degraded.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The PE Strip-Mining Operation:</strong> 4,000+ physician practices acquired, 40% of dental consolidated, accounting and law firms disappearing daily. These professionals thought they were getting liquidity instead they became employees watching their life's work generate someone else's returns.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>What We're Creating: The Expert-Owned Alternative</h3>
            <p>Meridian 44 is our answer - a complete inversion of the extraction model.</p>
            <p>We're building infrastructure where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expert contributions become equity stakes through SAFE agreements</li>
                <li>Knowledge generates ongoing royalties instead of one-time sales</li>
                <li>Professionals keep their businesses while building proprietary tech assets</li>
                <li>Custom solutions enhance expertise rather than replacing it with generic software</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our architecture: 44 specialized verticals, 4,000-6,000 verified experts, each documenting and contributing expertise to train AI that they actually own.</p>
            
            <h3>The Financial Engineering We've Developed</h3>
            <p><strong>For our expert partners, we enable:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>35-45% taxable income reduction through strategic expense allocation</li>
                <li>Ordinary income → capital gains conversion (17-27% rate differential)</li>
                <li>$10M+ platform value creation from $500K-$1M investment</li>
                <li>$1.5M+ licensing revenue generation over 10 years</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>For us, we're building:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defensible moats through verified expert training data</li>
                <li>Network effects through peer review and quality assurance</li>
                <li>Recurring revenue through platform royalties and licensing</li>
                <li>Exit optionality through distributed ownership that prevents hostile takeover</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why This Aligns With Everything We're Doing</h3>
            <p>Meridian 44 embodies our core thesis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decentralized ownership prevents the concentrated power we're fighting against</li>
                <li>Utility layer thinking makes expert knowledge as accessible as electricity</li>
                <li>Stewardship values ensure experts benefit from their contributions forever</li>
                <li>Collaborative model proves the smartest people really aren't always in our room</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="venture-section">
            <h2>Trade Stone Group: The Financial Engine and Investor Network</h2>
            <p>Trade Stone Group is probably the least defined piece of this whole picture because there are so many different opportunities (along with risks) that can be generated from TSG. While there have been a ton of ideas over the last few years (and some I'm sure you've had that I don't even know about), the heart behind Trade Stone Group has been stewardship, the opportunity to give back and bless people, the opportunity to create wealth, and to create stability among increasing economic uncertainty.</p>
            <p>We've frameworked a number of models for investment types, additional private funds, public funds, and even a fintech firm. Whether or not any of that happens, or if it happens under TSG or a whole different set of entities, is still up in the air. But, on my side I want to honor the work everyone put into creating unique and excellent strategies while being a good steward of the massive financial blessing God's given us the opportunity to be a part of.
