            <h2>Our Values: The Foundation</h2>
            <p>From the start of walking down the road of building something, we wanted to make sure whatever we were a part of stood on values and ACTUALLY lived and worked those values. No one is perfect, and we know we'll mess up at times, but we always want to filter the decisions being made through this set of values and ensure they set the tone for everything we do.</p>
            
            <h3>Two Foundations, Seven Expressions</h3>
            <p>Every value we hold flows from two foundational commitments: People First and Courage. People First means we put relationships, trust, and human dignity at the center of every decision. Courage means we take on the hard challenges, choose growth over comfort, and do what's right even when it's difficult. Together, these foundations shape how we show up every day.</p>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Relationships – People Over Profit, Always</div>
                <p>Business isn't a transaction, it's personal. We build genuine partnerships that last, valuing long-term connection over short-term gains. We treat people right because it matters to us - not because it's "good business." Trust, respect, and fairness aren't optional. They're how we operate.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Stewardship – Build with Integrity, Execute with Honor</div>
                <p>We share information openly and follow through on commitments. When we make mistakes, we own them and extract the lessons. We protect both our team and our partners because their success is our success. Trust grows from consistent actions, not promises.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Improvement – Consistent Growth Over Time</div>
                <p>Nothing in nature stays still, it either grows or dies. We need continuous evolution to feel alive and purposeful. When we stop learning, we stagnate. When we embrace change and push ourselves daily, we thrive. We choose growth because it energizes us, challenges us, and ensures we're building something that lasts.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Wisdom – Honor Experience, Welcome Change</div>
                <p>We balance experienced perspectives with fresh thinking, data with discernment, and action with reflection. This blend of stability and innovation creates space for meaningful insights. We stay humble enough to learn, thoughtful enough to question, and confident enough to act.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Courage – Take the Hard Road, Do What Others Won't</div>
                <p>We take on the hard problems others shy away from. Meaningful challenges energize us, they fulfill our need to contribute and grow. When the path gets difficult, our values keep us moving forward. Conviction drives us, not fear.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Revelry – Life Should Be Fun</div>
                <p>Work should energize us, not drain us. When we have fun, we're more creative, more connected, and more effective. Positivity fuels momentum. If success doesn't feel good, we're doing it wrong. We choose joy because it brings out our best work.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="value-item">
                <div class="value-title">Collaboration – The Smartest People in the Room Aren't Always in the Room</div>
                <p>We don't believe in lone wolves. We move fast because we leverage collective intelligence, not individual ego. Diverse perspectives make us better. Different insights, backgrounds, and expertise create stronger solutions. The best execution happens together.</p>

            <p>We want NineOneSix to be like the power company, or Verizon, no one thinks about the power company, they just know they all have to use it.</p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>We envision a world where business infrastructure is as invisible and reliable as electricity - where every founder can build their dreams without sacrificing the relationships and moments that matter most. NineOneSix Systems will transform business ownership from a prison of endless tasks into a vehicle for passion, creativity, and human connection.</p>
                
                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>At NineOneSix Systems, our mission is to build a decentralized core utility layer, intentionally diluted across dozens of aligned owners to prevent concentrated power, safeguard against corruption, and foster resilience and innovation through broad, equitable equity distribution. From this foundation, we will spin off multiple sub-companies, some directly affiliated, others independent, each aligned with our vision, featuring concentrated ownership for dedicated operators and stakeholders, with non-universal overlap to promote expertise, accountability, and majority stakes, as we collectively reshape the future of business.</p>

        <!-- Lucepta Section -->
        <section class="venture-section">
            <h2>Lucepta: How We Got Here and why we are committed to Healthcare Technology</h2>
            <p>Our dedication to healthcare technology embodies our core values: "People First and Do Hard Things." We deliberately chose pharmacy and healthcare because it offers the greatest opportunity to genuinely help people (both business owners and patients) while tackling one of the most challenging industries to reform.</p>
            <p>Healthcare technology brought us together as an organization. It sparked the creation of our initial entity, drove the formation of NineOneSix, shaped our leadership team, and defined our strategic direction, from SEC registration and revenue strategy to expanding Trade Stone Group's portfolio.</p>
            <p>More importantly, this focus fulfills our vision of enabling business owners to build their dreams without sacrificing what matters most. Independent pharmacy owners exemplify this need - healthcare professionals who entered business to serve their communities but face crushing challenges from inadequate technology, fragmented vendors, and systemic industry dysfunction.</p>
            <p>We chose healthcare technology not despite its complexity, but because of it. Reforming this industry represents the ultimate expression of our values: putting people first by serving those who serve others, and doing the hard things by taking on one of the most entrenched and difficult sectors to transform.</p>
            
            <p>We've been working for the past year on several fronts that combine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reverse Distribution</li>
                <li>Pharmacy Supply</li>
                <li>Pharmacy Rx Renewals</li>
                <li>Pharmacy Short Fills</li>
                <li>Medical DME Supply</li>
                <li>Clinical Services (RPM, CCM, RTM, CMR, CMM)</li>
                <li>SaaS EMR Platform w/ Lab Integration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Our plan:</strong> Consolidate all of these services into one solution - Lucepta.</p>
            
            <p>Combined, we believe this to be a business model capable of reaching $100-500MM in valuation within the next 5 years.</p>

            <h2>Meridian 44: The Paradigm Shift We're Building</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem We're Attacking</h3>
            <p>We see two massive value extractions destroying professional expertise:</p>
            
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>The AI Training Heist:</strong> OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google built $100B+ scraping expert content without compensation. The result? Mediocre AI creating medical errors, legal sanctions, and what Apple Research calls an "illusion of thinking." We're watching decades of professional knowledge get stolen, commoditized, and degraded.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The PE Strip-Mining Operation:</strong> 4,000+ physician practices acquired, 40% of dental consolidated, accounting and law firms disappearing daily. These professionals thought they were getting liquidity instead they became employees watching their life's work generate someone else's returns.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>What We're Creating: The Expert-Owned Alternative</h3>
            <p>Meridian 44 is our answer - a complete inversion of the extraction model.</p>
            <p>We're building infrastructure where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expert contributions become equity stakes through SAFE agreements</li>
                <li>Knowledge generates ongoing royalties instead of one-time sales</li>
                <li>Professionals keep their businesses while building proprietary tech assets</li>
                <li>Custom solutions enhance expertise rather than replacing it with generic software</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our architecture: 44 specialized verticals, 4,000-6,000 verified experts, each documenting and contributing expertise to train AI that they actually own.</p>
            
            <h3>The Financial Engineering We've Developed</h3>

                <li>35-45% taxable income reduction through strategic expense allocation</li>
                <li>Ordinary income → capital gains conversion (17-27% rate differential)</li>
                <li>$5M+ platform value creation from $500K-$1M investment</li>
                <li>$1.5M+ licensing revenue generation over 10 years</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This is one of the hardest things we've ever done. We've always heard 'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.'</p>
            <p>What we're building isn't just another business. We are reimagining the fundamentals of how business works when it honors human needs and connections. NineOneSix creates the invisible infrastructure. Meridian 44 returns ownership to experts. Trade Stone Group engineers financial resilience. Lucepta demonstrates how addressing complex challenges creates opportunities to serve humanity.</p>
            <p>This is one of the hardest things we've ever done, and that's exactly why we're doing it. While we observe AI companies extracting billions from expert knowledge and private equity strip-mining professional practices, we're building the alternative: decentralized ownership that resists corruption, expert-owned platforms that generate equity not extraction, and infrastructure that puts people first.</p>
            <p>We recognize this vision is massive. There will be moments when the easy path calls. In those moments, we return to our foundations: People First and Courage. These guide every decision, every pivot, every breakthrough.</p>
            <p>We're grateful you're choosing the hard road with us, thank you - and thank you for allowing us to partner with YOU.</p>
            <p>Welcome to the revolution. Let's build.</p>
